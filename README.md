# 👋 Hi, I'm Jorge Serna

🎵 Musician turned programmer | 💻 Full-Stack Developer in the making | 🌐 Based in Monterrey, México

I'm currently studying software development and building projects through [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I believe that creativity, whether through music or code, is a powerful tool for building meaningful experiences.

- 🔧 Full-Stack projects with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Python. Kinda interested in .NET, coming soon.
- 🌱 Learning React and Node.js
